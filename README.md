# Not Enough Calculation

## Prerequisites

* JavaFX 8 installation

    * If you're getting `ClassNotFoundException`s regarding `nec.gui.NecApp` for seemingly no reason, this is likely the cause.

    * Azul provides JDK builds including JavaFX:
      https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?version=java-8-lts&architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jdk-fx

* A recipe database (`nec.db`)

    * A prebuilt GTNH 2.0.9.0 database is available under Releases

    * A flow for building the database from a `RecEx` dump is pending, the code is present however.
